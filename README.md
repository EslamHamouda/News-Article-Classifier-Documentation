# News-Article-Classifier-Documentation
## 1. Description of the Machine Learning Algorithm Used:
The News Article Classifier utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. Naive Bayes is a
probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that the presence of a particular feature
(word) in a class (category) is independent of the presence of other features. This assumption allows for
fast and efficient classification of text data.
The specific variant of Naive Bayes used in this implementation is Multinomial Naive Bayes. It is
suitable for discrete feature data, such as word counts, which makes it well-suited for text classification
tasks. Multinomial Naive Bayes models the probability distribution of the features in each class and uses
Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of a class given a document.
## 2. Optimizations Made
The implementation incorporates several optimizations to improve the performance and accuracy of the
News Article Classifier:
a) Text Preprocessing: Before training the classifier, the text data undergoes preprocessing steps.
Punctuation marks are removed, the text is tokenized into individual words, stop words (commonly
occurring words like "the," "and," etc.) are removed, and words are stemmed to their base form using
Porter stemming algorithm. These preprocessing steps help in reducing the dimensionality of the feature
space and removing noise from the data.
b) Vectorization: The implementation utilizes the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the
preprocessed text data into numerical feature vectors. The CountVectorizer represents the text data as a
matrix of token counts, capturing the frequency of each word in each document. This vectorization
technique enables the Naive Bayes classifier to work with the data.
c) Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function
from scikit-learn. This allows for evaluating the performance of the classifier on unseen data. The default
split ratio is set to 80% for training and 20% for testing.
## 3. Analysis of Program's Performance and Limitations
The News Article Classifier demonstrates promising performance in categorizing news articles into
predefined categories. However, there are certain performance considerations and limitations to be aware
of:
a) Performance:Accuracy Metrics: The implementation calculates various evaluation metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the classifier. These metrics provide insights
into how well the model predicts the categories.
Efficiency: The Naive Bayes algorithm is computationally efficient and scales well with large datasets.
The vectorization technique used also helps in handling large feature spaces. However, the performance
may still be influenced by the size and complexity of the dataset.
b) Limitations:
Class Imbalance: If the dataset has imbalanced class distributions (i.e., significantly more articles in one
category compared to others), it may affect the model's ability to accurately predict underrepresented
categories.
Vocabulary Limitations: The model relies on the vocabulary learned during training. If there are words in
the testing data that were not present in the training data, the model may struggle to classify such cases
effectively.
Contextual Understanding: The Naive Bayes algorithm assumes independence between features, which
may limit its ability to capture complex semantic relationships between words. Consequently, the model
may struggle with understanding nuanced contexts in news articles.
Generalization: While the classifier performs well on the given dataset, its performance on different
datasets or domains may vary. It is important to validate the classifier's performance on new data specific
to the target domain.
## Conclusion
The News Article Classifier utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm and text preprocessing techniques to
classify news articles into categories. It incorporates optimizations such as text cleaning, vectorization,
and train-test splitting to improve accuracy and efficiency. The performance of the classifier is evaluated
using various metrics, and limitations related to class imbalance, vocabulary limitations, contextual
understanding, and generalization are acknowledged. Overall, the implementation provides a solid
foundation for categorizing news articles, but careful consideration of the limitations is necessary when
applying it to new datasets or domains.
